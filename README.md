# Logging  practice
There is 2 servers: **web** and **log**. **web** has a nginx server which produced logs. **log** is a remote server to collect logs.

- all critical logs from **web** must be stored locally and sent on the **log**  
- access and error logs from nginx have to be sent on the **log**  
- audit logs (when nginx config changes) have to be sent on the **log**
